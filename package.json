  "readme": "# `refmterr`: Reason Formatting of Errors for Native Builds.\n\n#### Demo\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esy-ocaml/BetterErrors/master/demo.png)\n\n\n## Support\n\n- This is an [`esy`](https://github.com/esy-ocaml/esy) compatible package.\n- Supports `ocamlopt/ocamlc` versions `4.02.3`-`4.05`.\n\n## Usage\n\n**Package Builds:**\n\nAdd a dependency on `refmterr`, and `@opam/reason` in your `dependencies`, and\nthen you will be able to wrap your build commands with `refmterr`. For example,\ninstead of using `make build` as your build command, use `remfterr make build`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"esy\": {\n    \"build\":  [\n      [\"refmterr make build\"]\n    ],\n    ...\n  },\n\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"refmterr\": \"^3.0.0\",\n    \"@opam/reason\": \"^3.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Command Line Usage:**\n\nYou can wrap any command that outputs `ocamlopt/ocamlc` error messages.  For\nexample, from your sandboxed project with the above `package.json`, you could\nrun:\n\n```sh\nesy refmterr ocamlopt -pp refmt someFile.re\n```\n\nand have any errors/warnings printed more readably.\n\n## Contributing\n\n- Install the latest esy `npm install -g esy`.\n- `git clone` this repo, `cd` into it, then run:\n```sh\nesy install\nesy build\nesy ./runTests.sh\n```\n",
